## June 2022 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine)

This project was only needed as a shell for loading the PropertyWebBuilder engine. As this is no longer needed this project has been discontinued.  You can now deploy PropertyWebBuilder directly!

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):
